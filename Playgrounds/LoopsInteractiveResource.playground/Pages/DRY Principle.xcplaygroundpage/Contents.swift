## DRY Principle

In software development, there is a principle called Don't Repeat Yourself (the DRY Principle). There is also a saying that the best programmers are the lazy ones, because they want to save themselves as much effort as possible through automation
 
This morning, we sang some repetitive songs. Before today, when we wanted to perform repetitive actions, we had to type each statement out.
